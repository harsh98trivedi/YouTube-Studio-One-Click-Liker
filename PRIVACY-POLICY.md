# Privacy Policy for YouTube Studio One-Click Liker

**Last Updated:** September 4, 2025

Thank you for using the YouTube Studio One-Click Liker Chrome Extension. This privacy policy outlines how the extension handles your data.

### Data Collection and Usage

The YouTube Studio One-Click Liker extension is designed with your privacy as a top priority.

- **No Personal Data is Collected:** The extension does not collect, store, or transmit any personally identifiable information (PII), such as your name, email address, or user credentials.
- **No Data Transmission:** All operations performed by the extension occur locally within your browser on the YouTube Studio page. No data is sent to any external server.
- **Website Content Interaction:** The extension interacts with the content of the YouTube Studio comments page for the sole purpose of identifying and clicking the "heart" icons. This interaction is limited to the single function of the extension and is only initiated when you click the extension's icon.

### Permissions

The extension requires the following permissions for its functionality:

- `scripting`: To execute the code that likes the comments.
- `activeTab`: To run only on the currently active YouTube Studio tab when you invoke it.
- `tabs`: To verify that the script is running on the correct YouTube Studio URL.

These permissions are used exclusively to provide the extension's stated feature and do not grant access to your data outside of this single purpose.

### Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy in the future if the extension's functionality changes. Any updates will be reflected in a new version of the extension and an updated policy document.
